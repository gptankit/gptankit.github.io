            <li>Adaptive Request Modeling in Clusters during Adverse States</li>
            <p>Published research paper that introduces methods to adapt to adverse cluster states in order to maximize success probability
              of http/tcp requests to the cluster. Two methods are talked about in the paper namely - <b>Probabilistic Request Dispatch</b> and <b>Request Buffering</b>.

              <b>Abstract</b>: A distributed system consists of multiple nodes that share incoming
              load among themselves. In a centrally coordinated environment, the responsibility falls 
              on a gateway to manage request dispatch to this cluster of nodes. In this paper, we propose
              an adaptive and unified approach to request dispatch to enhance decision making capabilities 
              of such a gateway in case of partial and total cluster shutdown states. Using the described
              algorithms as a base, we derive a formula for landing probability on a node and explore 
              its implication on various cluster states. We also show, via graphs, the request dispatch 
              pattern when using this approach with adverse cluster states.

            <li>Improved Range Approximation in BLE Receivers</li>
            <p>Published public proposal for improving range approximation in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) receivers. 
              The relation between path attenuation and distance is derived using power formulas and equation parameters
              are calculated using experiments and multiple regressions.

              <b>Abstract</b>: A BLE (short for Bluetooth Low Energy) transmitter is a radio-based system used
              to transfer a few bytes of pre-programmed data to any other BLE device capable of receiving 
              it. It relays a set of radio waves with frequency range of 2.4 GHz which consists of 
              encoded information about fields necessary to recognize this device and make subsequent 
              connections work. As with any energy transfer, there is bound to be a dissipation in its 
              strength as the distance from the source increases. This power loss is usually caused by 
              interference, diffraction or absorption of the transmitted signal. In this article, I am 
              going to share my findings and derive the relation of power attenuation with the distance
              of the receiver from the source.
