          I joined IIIT-Hyderabad in the year 2006 after having cleared IIT-JEE and AIEEE examinations.
          My interest for computers and technology in general led me to a formal education in Computer Science. 
          IIIT-Hyderabad actively encourages research at undergraduate level and it is reflected in the curriculum. 
          Had great fun deep diving into theoretical computer science aspects such as automata theory, algorithms and scientific computing.
          Taught Software Engineering course as Teaching Assistant for a semester.
